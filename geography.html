		<p class= "text">As shown on the map published on the Century City Chamber of Commerce website, Century City is generally bounded by Santa Monica Boulevard to the north, the city of Beverly Hills to the east, Pico Boulevard to the south, and Century Park West to the west (including the west side of Century Park West between Santa Monica Boulevard and Constellation Boulevard). These boundaries correspond with those recognized by the Century City Business Improvement District Association. Neighboring Century City are Beverly Hills to the east, Cheviot Hills to the south, West Los Angeles to the west, and Westwood to the north. </p>
		<p class= "text">The Mapping L.A. project of the Los Angeles Times extends Century City's western boundary to Beverly Glen Boulevard. However, this more expansive definition appears to conflict with other L.A. Times reports: a 1999 article sets Century Park West as the neighborhood's western boundary, and a 2017 article refers to the neighborhood bounded by Century City to the east and Beverly Glen Boulevard to the west as a distinct neighborhood.</p>
		<p class= "text"> Two specific plans cover the neighborhood: "Century City North Specific Plan for the retail, office, and entertainment functions in Century City," and "Century City South Specific Plan for multi-family homes, office tower, hotel and Fox Studios," according to the community plan set forth by the Los Angeles Department of City Planning.</p>
